# Linear discriminant analysis

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a constrained (canonical)
technique that allows you to determine how well your independent set of
variables explains an a priori grouping. This grouping may have been
obtained from a previous clustering analysis (see Workshop 8) or from a
hypothesis (e.g. grouping is based on sites at different latitudes or
different treatments). An LDA can also be used to classify new data into
these pre-determined groups. You can imagine some useful applications of
this technique including assessing which population a fish should be
classified in based on morphology or classifying whether a new paper is
a freshwater, marine or terrestrial study based on the abstract of
papers in those pre-determined biomes.

LDA computes discriminant functions from standardized descriptors. These
coefficients quantify the relative contributions of the (standardized)
explanatory variables to the discrimination of objects. Identification
functions can be computed from the original (not standardized)
descriptors to classify new data into pre-determined groups. Let's
continue to work with the Doubs fish data. First we must ensure that the
within-group covariance matrices of the explanatory variables are
homogeneous -- a condition necessary for the application of LDA.

First we want to make an a priori classification that is independent
from the environmental data set. We know that there is a general
relationship that indicates environmental variables change with latitude
(Budyko 1969). Here we will classify our Doubs fish sites based on
latitude to determine how well the environmental factors explain our
latitude grouping. Our groups are determined by simply dividing the
range of latitudes equally into three groups and then assigning each
site to a group depending on where they fall along the divided range.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#load spatial data to determine groups 
spa <- read.csv ('http://www.davidzeleny.net/anadat-r/data-download/DoubsSpa.csv', row.names = 1)
spa <- spa[,-8]

#View spatial data 
View (spa)

#add site numbers
numbers<-(1:30)
numbers<-numbers[!numbers%in%8] 
spa$site<-numbers

#make groups based on lattitude y<82=group1, 82<y<156=group2, y>156=group3
spa.group<-ddply(.data=spa, .variables=.(x, y, site), .fun= summarise, group = if(y <= 82) 1 else if (y <= 156) 2 else 3)

#order by site
spa.group<-spa.group[with(spa.group, order(site)), ]
```

Generally, we would first want to check that the within-group covariance
matrices of the explanatory variables are homogeneous by verifying
multivariate homogeneity of within-group covariance (MHV). For the
purposes of this workshop we will by pass it but more information can be
found in Borcard et al. (2011).

Once we run the LDA we can use the result object to determine 1. What
groups the sites are classified in based on the environmental data. 2.
What are the posterior probabilities of that the sites to belong to the
groups. 3. The percentage of correct classification based on our
latitudinal grouping.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#run LDA
LDA<-lda(env,spa.group[,4])

#classification of the objects based on LDA
spe.class <- predict(LDA)$class

#posterior probabilities of the objects to belong to the groups
spe.post <- predict(LDA)$posterior

#table of prior versus predicted classifications
spe.table <- table(spa.group[,4], spe.class)

#proportion of correct classification
diag(prop.table(spe.table, 1))
```

The results suggest that the environmental factors explain the first,
lower latitude, group and the group 3 perfectly but only 83% of the
group 2 sites were predicted correctly. What does that tell us about our
classification? Perhaps there are stronger delineations in the lower and
higher latitude and the group 2 is a mix of both?

Now what we have some new sites and we want to classify them based on
the relationship we have established between our latitudinal grouping
and environmental factors using the LDA. Using the predict() function we
can load in a new matrix with sites and classify them using the LDA
object.

Load in the classifyme.csv file, which contains dummy data from 5 new
sites.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#predicting classification of new data 
#read in new sites 
classify.me<-read.csv("classifyme.csv", header = T)

#predict grouping of new data
predict.group<-predict(LDA, newdata=classify.me)

#give classification for each new site
group.new<-predict.group$class
```

![](images/lda_newgroups.png){.align-center width="200"}

Our new sites, in order, have been classified in groups 1,1, 1, 3 and 3
respectively.

**Challenge 5**: Run an LDA for the mite env data (only first two vars)
based on four latitudinal groups you create from the mite.xy data set.
What group was group 2 most incorrectly grouped into? What proportion of
sites was correctly classified in group 1? group 2?

**Challenge 5**: Solution



```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
mite.xy$site<-seq(1:70)
(max(mite.xy[,2])-min(mite.xy[,2]))/4

mite.xy.group<-ddply(.data=mite.xy, .variables=.(x, y, site), .fun= summarise, group = if(y <= 2.5) 1 else if (y <= 4.9) 2 else if (y <= 7.3) 3 else 4)
mite.xy.group<-mite.xy.group[with(mite.xy.group, order(site)), ]

LDA.mite<-lda(mite.env[,1:2],mite.xy.group[,4])
mite.class <- predict(LDA.mite)$class
mite.post <- predict(LDA.mite)$posterior
mite.table <- table(mite.xy.group[,4], mite.class)
diag(prop.table(mite.table, 1))
```
