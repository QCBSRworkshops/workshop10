# Exploring the dataset

We will continue to use the Doubs river datasets for this workshop.
"DoubsSpe.csv" is a data frame of fish community data where the first
column contains site names from 1 to 30 and the remaining columns are
fish taxa. The taxa columns are populated by fish abundance data
(counts). "DoubsEnv.csv" is a data frame of environmental data for the
same sites contained in the fish community data frame. Again, the first
column contains site names from 1 to 30. The remaining columns contain
measurements for 11 abiotic variables. Note that data used in ordination
analyses is generally in
[wide-format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#Species community data frame (fish abundance): “DoubsSpe.csv”
spe<- read.csv(file.choose(), row.names=1)
spe<- spe[-8,] #Site number 8 contains no species and so row 8 (site 8) is removed. Be careful to
#only run this command line once as you are overwriting "spe" each time. 

#Environmental data frame: “DoubsEnv.csv”
env<- read.csv(file.choose(), row.names=1)
env<- env[-8,] #Remove corresponding abiotic data for site 8 (since removed from fish data). 
#Again, be careful to only run the last line once. 
```

## Species data

We can use summary functions to explore the "spe" data (fish community
data) and discover things like the dimensions of the matrix, column
headings and summary statistics for the columns. This is a review from
Workshop 2.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
names(spe) #see names of columns in spe
dim(spe) #dimensions of spe; number of columns and rows 
str(spe) #displays internal structure of objects
head(spe) #first few rows of the data frame
summary(spe) #summary statistics for each column; min value, median value, max value, mean value etc.  
```

Look at the species' distribution frequencies.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#Species distribution
(ab <- table(unlist(spe))) #note that when you put an entire line of code in brackets like this, the output for that operation is displayed right away in the R console

barplot(ab, las=1, xlab="Abundance class", ylab="Frequency", col=grey(5:0/5))
```

![](images/spe_barplot.png){width="300"} Can see that there is a high
frequency of zeros in the abundance data.

See how many absences there are in the fish community data.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sum(spe==0) 
```

Look at the proportion of zeros in the fish community data.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
sum(spe==0)/(nrow(spe)*ncol(spe))
```

The proportion of zeros in the dataset is \~0.5.

This is high but not uncommon for species abundance data. However, in
order to avoid the use of double-zeros as indications of resemblance
among sites, we will apply a transformation to the species data.
Legendre and Gallagher (2001) proposed five pre-transformations of the
species data, four of them being available in vegan in the function
decostand().

The Hellinger transformation will be applied to the fish data. It
expresses abundances as the square-root of their relative abundance at
each site (Borcard et al. 2011).

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
spe.hel <- decostand(spe, method="hellinger") # you can also use method="hell" 
```

## Environmental data

Explore the environmental data and create a panel of plots to compare
collinearity:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
names(env)
dim(env)
str(env)
head(env)
summary(env)
pairs(env, main="Bivariate Plots of the Environmental Data" ) 
```

In this case, the environmental data (explanatory variables) are all in
different units and need to be standardized prior to computing distance
measures to perform most ordination analyses. Standardize the
environmental data (11 variables) using the function decostand() in
vegan.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
env.z <- decostand(env, method="standardize")
apply(env.z, 2, mean) # the data are now centered (means~0)
apply(env.z, 2, sd)   # the data are now scaled (standard deviations=1)
```
