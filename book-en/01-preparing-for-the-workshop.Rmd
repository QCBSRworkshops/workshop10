# (PART\*) Advanced Multivariate Analyses in `R` {-}

# Learning objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to perform advanced
multivariate analyses on community data. This workshop concentrates on
constrained methods such as redundancy analysis (RDA), multivariate
regression tree (MRT) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to explore
how environmental variables may be driving patterns in species
assemblage across sites.

###                                                                             #
### This is an automatically generated script based on the code chunks from the #
### book for this workshop.                                                     #
###                                                                             #
### It is minimally annotated to allow participants to provide their comments:  # 
### a practice that we highly encourage.                                        #
###                                                                             #
### Note that the solutions to the challenges are also included in this script. #
### When solving the challenges by yourself, attempt to not scroll and peek at  #
### the solutions.                                                              #
###                                                                             #
### Happy coding!                                                               #

All workshop materials are found at [github.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop10](https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop10). This includes an [R script](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshop10/book-en/workshop10-script-en.R) which contains all code chunks shown in this book.

For this workshop, we will be working with the following datasets:

* [DoubsEnv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop10/main/pres-en/data/doubsenv.csv)  
* [DoubsSpe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop10/main/pres-en/data/doubsspe.csv)  
* [DoubsSpa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop10/main/pres-en/data/doubsspa.csv)  
* [Test data for linear discriminant analyses](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop10/main/pres-en/data/classifyme.csv)  
  
> To download this data, do right click + save on the page that opens.

You should also make sure you have downloaded, installed, and loaded these packages:
 
* [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=vegan) (for multivariate
      analyses)
* [labdsv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=labdsv) (for identification of significant indicator species in the
     multivariate regression tree analysis)
* [MASS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MASS) (for linear discriminant
   analysis)
* [mvpart](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/mvpart/mvpart_1.6-2.tar.gz)* (for multivariate regression trees)
* [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) (for plotting some results)


```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# Install the required packages
install.packages("vegan")
install.packages("labdsv")
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("ggplot2")

# install mvpart from package archive file
install.packages("remotes")

```

> *The `mvpart` package is no longer hosted on CRAN, but is still available from the archives. To install `mvpart`, you can also download the .tar.gz version from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/mvpart/mvpart_1.6-2.tar.gz) and go to the "Packages" tab on the bottom right panel of R Studio, and click on "Install Packages". Choose to install from Package Archive file, and select the .tar.gz for `mvpart`.
