# (PART\*) Constrained ordinations {.unnumbered}

# What are "constrained" ordinations?

Described first by @rao1964, canonical analysis is a generic term that for several types of statistical analyses sharing a common goal, which is to identify the relationship between a multivariate response table (matrix $Y$, generally describing the species composition of communities) and a multivariate explanatory table (matrix $X$, generally containing environmental descriptors) by combining ordination and regression concepts. 

Canonical analyses allow users to **test ecological hypothesis concerning the environmental drivers of species composition**. Among the diversity of canonical analysis, we will mainly focus here on Redundancy Analysis (RDA).
