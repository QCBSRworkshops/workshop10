# Why "advanced multivariate methods"?

The [previous workshop](https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops/workshop09) presented the basics of multivariate analyses:
  
* How to choose appropriate distance metrics and transformations
* Hierarchical clustering
* Unconstrained ordinations 
  * Principal component analysis
  * Principal coordinate Analysis
  * Correspondence analysis
  * Nonmetric multidimensional scaling

The present workshop builds on this knowledge, and will focus on
**constrained** analyses. All the methods overviewed during Workshop 9 allowed us to find *patterns* in the community composition data or
in the descriptors, but not to explore **how environmental variables could
be driving these patterns**. With constrained analyses, such as redundancy
analysis (RDA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and multivariate
regression tree (MRT), one can describe and predict relationships
between community composition data and environmental variables.
