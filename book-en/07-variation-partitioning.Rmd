# Variation partitioning

Variation partitioning is a type of analysis that combines RDA and
partial RDA to divide the variation of a response variable among two,
three or four explanatory data sets. Variation partitioning are
generally represented by Venn diagram in which the percentage of
explained variance by each explanatory data set (or combination of data
stets) is reported.

In the case of two datasets (below): - Fraction a + b +c is the
explained variance by the two datasets calculated using a RDA of y by X
+ W. - Fraction d is the unexplained variance by the two datasets
calculated using the same RDA as above. - Fraction a is the explained
variance by the X data set only calculated using a partial of y by X
with W as covariables. - Fraction c is the explained variance by the W
data set only calculated using a partial of y by W with X as
covariables. - Fraction b is calculated by subtraction, i.e. b = \[a +
b\] + \[b + c\] - \[a + b + c\].

Venn diagram of partition of the variation of a response variable y
among two sets of explanatory variables X and W (from Legendre and
Legendre 2012).

Variation partitioning is thus an indicated analysis when user what to
relate the abundance of species in a community to various type of
environmental variables, for example abiotic vs biotic variables,
large-scale versus small-scale variables, etc. In the next example, we
will partition the variation of fish species composition between
chemical and physiographic variables.

In R, variation partitioning is performed using the function varpart().
Venn diagrams can also be drawn using the function plot().

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
?varpart
vegandocs("partitioning.pdf")
 
#Variation partitioning with all explanatory variables
spe.part.all <- varpart(spe.hel, envchem, envtopo)
spe.part.all
windows(title="Variation partitioning - all variables")
plot(spe.part.all, digits=2)  
```

The output looks like: ![](images/varpart_output.png){.align-center}
![](images/varpart_output_venn.png){.align-center}

In this case, the chemical variables explain 24.10% of the fish species
composition, the physiographic variables explain 11.20% of the fish
species composition and the interaction of these two types of variables
explained 23.30% of the fish species composition. Note that the
varpart() function also identify the fractions that can be tested for
significance using the function anova.cca().

Users can also perform variation partitioning between data sets that
only contain significant environmental variables:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#RDA of chemistry variables
spe.chem <- rda(spe.hel~., data=envchem)
 
#Select significant chemistry variables
R2a.all.chem <- RsquareAdj(spe.chem)$adj.r.squared
ordiR2step(rda(spe.hel~1, data=envchem), 
           scope= formula(spe.chem), direction= "forward", R2scope=TRUE, pstep=1000)
names(envchem)
(envchem.pars <- envchem[, c( 4, 6, 7 )])
 
#RDA with other environmental variables
spe.topo <- rda(spe.hel~., data=envtopo)
R2a.all.topo <- RsquareAdj(spe.topo)$adj.r.squared
ordiR2step(rda(spe.hel~1, data=envtopo), 
           scope= formula(spe.topo), direction= "forward", R2scope=TRUE, pstep=1000)
names(envtopo)
envtopo.pars <- envtopo[, c(1,2)]
 
#Varpart
spe.part <- varpart(spe.hel, envchem.pars, envtopo.pars)
windows(title="Variation partitioning - parsimonious subsets")
plot(spe.part, digits=2)
 
#Tests of significance 
anova.cca(rda(spe.hel, envchem.pars), step=1000) # Test of fractions [a+b]
anova.cca(rda(spe.hel, envtopo.pars), step=1000) # Test of fractions [b+c]
env.pars <- cbind(envchem.pars, envtopo.pars) 
anova.cca(rda(spe.hel, env.pars), step=1000) # Test of fractions [a+b+c]
anova.cca(rda(spe.hel, envchem.pars, envtopo.pars), step=1000) # Test of fraction [a]
anova.cca(rda(spe.hel, envtopo.pars, envchem.pars), step=1000) # Test of fraction [c]
```

Now, the chemical variables explain 25.30% of the fish species
composition, the physiographic variables explain 14.20% of the fish
species composition and the interaction of these two types of variables
explained 19.60% of the fish species composition. All these fractions
are significant (p\<0.001).

**Challenge 3**: Perform variation partitioning of the mite species
abundances with a first dataset for the significant substrate variables
(SubsDens, WaterCont and Substrate) and a second dataset for the
significant other variables (Shrud and Topo). What proportion of the
variation are explained by each dataset? What are the significant
fractions ?

**Challenge 3**: Solution

 This is what your code may look like:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
str(mite.env)
(mite.subs=mite.env[,c(1,2,3)]) #First set of variables outlined in challenge 
(mite.other=mite.env[,c(4,5)]) #Second set of variables outlined in challenge 
 
#RDA for mite.subs
rda.mite.subs <- rda(mite.spe.hel~., data=mite.subs)
R2a.all.subs <- RsquareAdj(rda.mite.subs)$adj.r.squared
 
#Forward selection for mite.subs
ordiR2step(rda(mite.spe.hel~1, data=mite.subs), 
           scope= formula(rda.mite.subs), direction= "forward", R2scope=TRUE, pstep=1000)
names(mite.subs)
(mite.subs.pars <- mite.subs[, c(2, 3)])
 
#RDA for mite.other
rda.mite.other <- rda(mite.spe.hel~., data=mite.other)
R2a.all.other <- RsquareAdj(rda.mite.other)$adj.r.squared
 
#Forward selection for mite.other
ordiR2step(rda(mite.spe.hel~1, data=mite.other), 
           scope= formula(rda.mite.other), direction= "forward", R2scope=TRUE, pstep=1000)
names(mite.other)
(mite.other.pars <- mite.other[, c(1,2)])
 
#Variation partitioning
(mite.spe.part <- varpart(mite.spe.hel, ~WatrCont+Substrate, ~Shrub+Topo,
                          data=mite.env))
windows(title="Variation partitioning - parsimonious subsets")
plot(mite.spe.part, digits=2)
 
# Tests of all testable fractions
anova.cca(rda(mite.spe.hel~ WatrCont+Substrate, data=mite.env), step=1000) # Test of fractions [a+b]
anova.cca(rda(mite.spe.hel~Shrub+Topo, data=mite.env), step=1000) # Test of fractions [b+c]
(env.pars <- cbind(mite.env[,c(2,3,4,5)])) 
anova.cca(rda(mite.spe.hel~ WatrCont+Substrate+Shrub+Topo, data=env.pars), step=1000) # Test of fractions [a+b+c]
anova.cca(rda(mite.spe.hel~WatrCont+Substrate + Condition(Shrub+Topo), data=env.pars), step=1000) # Test of fraction [a]
anova.cca(rda(mite.spe.hel~Shrub+Topo+ Condition(WatrCont+Substrate ), data=env.pars), step=1000) # Test of fraction [c]
```

In this case, substrate variables explain 14.00% of the mite species
composition, the other environmental variables explain 9.1% of the mite
species composition and the interaction of these two types of vriables
explained 16.90% of the mite species composition. All these fractions
are significant (p\<0.001).
