# Redundancy analysis

Redundancy Analysis is a direct extension of multiple regression, as it
models the effect of an explanatory matrix X (n x p) on a response
matrix Y (n x m). This is done by preforming an ordination of Y to
obtain ordination axes that are linear combinations of the variables in
X. In RDA, ordination axes are calculating from a PCA of a matrix Yfit,
computed by fitting the Y variables to X by multivariate linear
regression. Note that the explanatory variables in X can be
quantitative, qualitative or binary variables. Prior to RDA, explanatory
variables in Y must be centered, standardized (if explanatory variables
are not dimensionally homogeneous, i.e. in different units), transformed
(to limit the skew of explanatory variables) or normalized (to linearize
relationships) following the same principles as in PCA. Collinearity
between the X variables should also be reduced before RDA.

In order to obtain the best model of RDA, explanatory variables can be
selected by forward, backward or stepwise selection that remove
non-significant explanatory variables.

RDA involves two computational steps. In the first step, a matrix of
fitted values Yfit is calculated trough the linear equation: Yfit =
X\[X'X\]-1 \[X'Y\]

In the second step, a PCA of the fitted matrix Yfit is calculated (see
equations in the figure below) and produce the canonical eigenvalues and
eigenvectors together with the matrix Z containing the canonical axes.
These canonical axes correspond to linear combinations of the
explanatory variables in X. This linearity of the combinations of the X
variables is a fundamental property of RDA. In the analysis of community
composition, these canonical axes are interpreted as complex
environmental gradients.

Redundancy analysis as a two-step process (from Legendre and Legendre
2012) Several statistics can be computed from RDA:

\- The R² measures the strength of the canonical relationship between Y
and X by calculating the proportion of the variation of Y explained by
the variables in X, - The adjusted R² also measures the strength of the
relationship between Y and X, but applies a correction of the R² to take
into account the number of explanatory variables, - The F-statistic
corresponds to an overall test of significance of an RDA by comparing
the computed model to a null model. This test is based on the null
hypothesis that the strength of the linear relationship calculated by
the R² is not larger than the value that would be obtained for unrelated
Y and X matrices of the same size. Note that F-statistics can also be
used to sequentially test the significance of each canonical axis.

In R, RDA can be computed using the function rda from package vegan, as
follows:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#Preparing the data prior to RDA
env.z <- subset(env.z, select = -das) # remove the "distance from the source" variable
 
#Running the RDA
?rda
spe.rda <- rda(spe.hel~., data=env.z)

### Extract the results
summary(spe.rda, display=NULL) 
 
#The results are called using summary:
summary(spe.rda, display=NULL) #display = NULL optional  
```

The summary of the output looks like this:

![](images/rda_output_1.png){.align-center}

These results contain the proportion of variance of Y explained by the X
variables (constrained proportion, 73.41% here), the unexplained
variance of Y (unconstrained proportion, 26.59% here) and then summarize
the eigenvalues, the proportions explained and the cumulative proportion
of each canonical axis (each canonical axis = each constraining
variable, in this case, the environmental variables from env).

To select the significant explanatory variables, you can then perform a
forward selection (or backwards or stepwise), using the ordiR2step()
function (or using the forward.sel function of package packfor):

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
### Select the significant explanatory variables by forward selection
?ordiR2step
ordiR2step(rda(spe.hel~1, data=env.z), scope= formula(spe.rda), direction= "forward", R2scope=TRUE, pstep=1000)
env.signif <- subset(env.z, select = c("alt", "oxy", "dbo"))
```

The resulting output reads: rda(formula = spe.hel \~ alt + oxy + dbo,
data = env.z) with the proportion of variation explained by the three
constraining variables being 0.59. So in this case, only three variables
are retained by the forward selection, i.e. alt, oxy and dbo. These
three variables can be placed in a new data frame env.signif to perform
the new RDA including only significant X variables:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
spe.rda.signif <- rda(spe.hel~., data=env.signif)
summary(spe.rda.signif, display=NULL)
```

The explanatory variables (altitude, oxygen and biological oxygen
demand) now explain 59% of the variance in Y (species). The adjusted R²
of this RDA is calculated using the function RsquareAdj:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
(R2adj <- RsquareAdj(spe.rda.signif)$adj.r.squared)
#Here the strength of the relationship between X and Y corrected for the number of X variables is 0.54.
```

The significance of the model and of each canonical axis can be tested
using the function anova (note this is different from retaining
significant variables as was done with forward selection, now we're
testing the significance of the RDA axes):

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
?anova.cca
anova.cca(spe.rda.signif, step=1000)
anova.cca(spe.rda.signif, step=1000, by="axis")
#In this case, the RDA model is highly significant (p=0.001) as well as all three canonical axes.
```

To visualize the results of the RDA, triplots can be drawn using the
plot(). Note that as in PCA, users can create scaling 1 and scaling 2
triplots. In scaling 1, distance among objects approximate their
Euclidean distances while in scaling 2, angles between variables X and Y
reflect their correlation. Thus, scaling 1 triplots can be used to
interpret distances among objects and scaling 2 triplots to interpret
the relationships between X and Y. To plot the scaling 1 triplots of the
RDA, the following code can be used:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#Quick plots scaling 1 and 2
windows()
plot(spe.rda.signif, scaling=1, main="Triplot RDA (scaling 1)")
windows()
plot(spe.rda.signif, scaling=2, main="Triplot RDA (scaling 2)")
 
#Advanced plots scaling 1
windows()
plot(spe.rda.signif, scaling=1, main="Triplot RDA - scaling 1", type="none", xlab=c("RDA1"), ylab=c("RDA2"), xlim=c(-1,1), ylim=c(-1,1))
points(scores(spe.rda.signif, display="sites", choices=c(1,2), scaling=1),
       pch=21, col="black", bg="steelblue", cex=1.2)
arrows(0,0,
       scores(spe.rda.signif, display="species", choices=c(1), scaling=1),
       scores(spe.rda.signif, display="species", choices=c(2), scaling=1),
       col="black",length=0)
text(scores(spe.rda.signif, display="species", choices=c(1), scaling=1),
     scores(spe.rda.signif, display="species", choices=c(2), scaling=1),
     labels=rownames(scores(spe.rda.signif, display="species", scaling=1)),
     col="black", cex=0.8)    
arrows(0,0,
       scores(spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(1), scaling=1),
       scores(spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(2), scaling=1),
       col="red")
text(scores(spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(1), scaling=1)+0.05,
     scores(spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(2), scaling=1)+0.05,
     labels=rownames(scores(spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(2), scaling=1)),
     col="red", cex=1) 
 
#Advanced plots scaling 2
windows()
plot(spe.rda.signif, scaling=2, main="Triplot RDA - scaling 2", type="none", xlab=c("RDA1"), ylab=c("RDA2"), xlim=c(-1,1), ylim=c(-1,1))
points(scores(spe.rda.signif, display="sites", choices=c(1,2), scaling=2),
       pch=21, col="black", bg="steelblue", cex=1.2)
arrows(0,0,
       scores(spe.rda.signif, display="species", choices=c(1), scaling=2)*2,
       scores(spe.rda.signif, display="species", choices=c(2), scaling=2)*2,
       col="black",length=0)
text(scores(spe.rda.signif, display="species", choices=c(1), scaling=2)*2.1,
     scores(spe.rda.signif, display="species", choices=c(2), scaling=2)*2.1,
     labels=rownames(scores(spe.rda.signif, display="species", scaling=2)),
     col="black", cex=0.8)    
arrows(0,0,
       scores(spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(1), scaling=2),
       scores(spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(2), scaling=2),
       col="red")
text(scores(spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(1), scaling=2)+0.05,
     scores(spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(2), scaling=2)+0.05,
     labels=rownames(scores(spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(2), scaling=2)),
     col="red", cex=1)  
```

And the final triplots would look like this:

**Challenge 1**: Run an RDA of the mite environmental variables
constraining the mite species abundances. Use:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#Load the mite species and environmental data from vegan package
data(mite) 
mite.spe<-mite
mite.spe.hel <- decostand(mite.spe, method="hellinger")

data(mite.env)
```

What are the significant explanatory variables? How much of the
variation in species data is explain by significant explanatory
variables (i.e. those that were selected)? What are the significant
axes? What group(s) of sites can you identify? What species are related
to each group(s) of sites?

**Challenge 1**: Solution

 Your code probably looks something like this:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
#Initial RDA with ALL of the environmental data
mite.spe.rda<-rda(mite.spe.hel~., data=mite.env)
 
#Select significant environmental variables
ordiR2step(rda(mite.spe.hel~1, data=mite.env), 
           scope= formula(mite.spe.rda), direction= "forward", R2scope=TRUE, pstep=1000)
 
#Create a new dataframe with only the significant variables that you identified above
mite.env.signif <- subset(mite.env, 
                          select = c("WatrCont", "Shrub", "Substrate", "Topo", "SubsDens"))
 
#Re-run the RDA with the significant variables and look at the summary
mite.spe.rda.signif=rda(mite.spe~., data=mite.env.signif)
summary(mite.spe.rda.signif, display=NULL)
 
#Find the R2 adjusted of the model with the retained environmental variables 
(R2adj <- RsquareAdj(mite.spe.rda.signif)$adj.r.squared)
 
#Determine the significant canonical (constrained) axes)
anova.cca(mite.spe.rda.signif, step=1000)
anova.cca(mite.spe.rda.signif, step=1000, by="axis")  
 
#Plot the RDA
windows()
plot(mite.spe.rda.signif, scaling=1, main="Triplot RDA - scaling 1", type="none", xlab=c("RDA1"), ylab=c("RDA2"), xlim=c(-1,1), ylim=c(-1,1))
points(scores(mite.spe.rda.signif, display="sites", choices=c(1,2), scaling=1),
       pch=21, col="black", bg="steelblue", cex=1.2)
text(scores(mite.spe.rda.signif, display="species", choices=c(1), scaling=1),
     scores(mite.spe.rda.signif, display="species", choices=c(2), scaling=1),
     labels=rownames(scores(mite.spe.rda.signif, display="species", scaling=1)),
     col="grey", cex=0.8)  
arrows(0,0,
      scores(mite.spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(1), scaling=1),
      scores(mite.spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(2), scaling=1),
      col="red")
text(scores(mite.spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(1), scaling=1)+0.05,
     scores(mite.spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(2), scaling=1)+0.05,
     labels=rownames(scores(mite.spe.rda.signif, display="bp", choices=c(2), scaling=1)),
     col="red", cex=1) 
```

Five explanatory variables are significant: WatrCont, Shrub, Substrate,
Topo, and SubsDens. The proportion of the variance explained by these
variables is 32.08% and the adjusted R² of this model is 19.20%. While
the first canonical is significant (p\<0.001), the overall model is
however not significant (p=0.107). Three groups of sites appear on the
triplot. One group of sites with high water content (top right) have
high abundance of species 9 and 25. Species 6, 12, 19 and 26 are related
to another group of sites with hummock topography (bottom left). The
last group of sites (top left) have not characteristic species and
heterogeneous environmental conditions. See the triplot below:
